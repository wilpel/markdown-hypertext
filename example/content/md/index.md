# SkySearch

SkySearch is a flight search API. You can search for flights between airports, view offers, and filter by cabin class or price.

## What you can do

- **Search flights** — find one-way offers between any two airports. See [[doc:flights]] for available routes and [[doc:flights-search]] to run a search.
- **Browse airports** — see which airports are supported in [[doc:airports]].
- **Get help** — if you're not sure where to start, see [[doc:help]].
