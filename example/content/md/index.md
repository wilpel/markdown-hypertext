# Wayfare

Wayfare is a travel search interface built for AI agents. It exposes flight and hotel search as a set of Markdown documents and JSON APIs that agents can navigate and call using standard HTTP requests. No browser, no scraping, no custom protocols — just read the pages and call the endpoints.

## What you can do

- **Search flights** — find one-way flight offers between any two cities. See [flights](/md/flights) for available cities and [search flights](/md/flights-search) for the search action.
- **Search hotels** — find hotels in any supported city. See [hotels](/md/hotels) for an overview and [search hotels](/md/hotels-search) for the search action.
- **Browse airports** — see which airports are supported in the [airport reference](/md/airports).
- **Get help** — if you're not sure where to start, see [getting started](/md/help).

## Cities served

Wayfare covers 15 cities across Europe and North America. Every city has flights to every other city and a selection of hotels. See [airports](/md/airports) for the full list.
