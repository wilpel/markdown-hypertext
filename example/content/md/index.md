# SkySearch

SkySearch is a flight search interface built for AI agents. It exposes flight search as a set of Markdown documents and JSON APIs that agents can navigate and call using standard HTTP requests. No browser, no scraping, no custom protocols — just read the pages and call the endpoints.

## What you can do

- **Search flights** — find one-way offers between any two airports. See [available routes](/md/flights) and [search flights](/md/flights-search) to run a search.
- **Browse airports** — see which airports are supported in the [airport reference](/md/airports).
- **Get help** — if you're not sure where to start, see [getting started](/md/help).

## Cities served

SkySearch covers 15 cities across Europe and North America. Every city connects to every other city. See [airports](/md/airports) for the full list of airport codes.
